# sort-cat-breed-UI

This a simple React application that consumes the sort-cat-breed-api which can be found [Here](https://github.com/andrewinsoul/catFindAPI)
<br/>
<br/>
N.B: This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You can now sort cat breeds based on how friendly they are to dog, children and strangers. This sorting is done in descending order meaning the top results are the more friendlier breeds.
